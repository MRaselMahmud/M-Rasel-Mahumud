    <h1>Research Interests</h1>
    <p>My main research interests include virtual, augmented, and mixed reality (XR), and human-computer interaction, artificial intelligence, and computer vision. My core research interests evolved around three primary research questions – 1) How to make XR more accessible and comfortable for a better user experience? 2) How can we develop autonomous XR technologies that are intelligent and safe? 3) How to use XR technologies to improve human life and solve real-life challenges? My research is interdisciplinary as it intersects with different research modalities, and I am always excited to collaborate with others from different fields of research.</p>
